An ideal is a subset I of elements in a ring R that forms an additive group and has the property that, whenever x belongs to R and y belongs to I, then xy and yx belong to I. For example, the set of even integers is an ideal in the ring of integers Z. 

That is to say if y is an even number(in I) and but x is not even (not in I) the result of xy or yx is also even (in I).
